Hey! I like programming, pretty much anything, my main programming language is Java (since that was my first language, if you ignore scratch), although I do have some knowledge on C too.

Below you have my "origin story" which covers my interests, expertise, the scope of my projects and the struggles I went through to get to where I am now. I have it in case someone wants to know just a bit more about me, or has faced similar struggles and can find hope or at least know they're not alone.

# Background

## The origin
Way before I started programming, in the sixth grade, I was building electronic circuits, things like simple counters (with 7seg displays), tesla coils (DRSSTC and Rotary SGTC), using microwave oven transformers etc. So my first interest was that, using ICs and making logic circuits, as well as more dangeous cool stuff. I really loved (and still do) logic, and so played Scrap Mechanic for 1.5k hours and made all kinds of fun logic things before soldering or making IRL circuits.

Two years before my love for programming began (2021-05-09), I built several Pulse Jet engines and uploaded several [videos on some](https://www.youtube.com/@alexlindgren858/videos) too, yet another thing I'm interested in.

## The Programming leap
My programming philosophy is quite different due to the way I learned how to code (And how I became self-taught).

A little more than three years ago, 2022-09-16, I was introduced to Java as a "beginner's language." At first, it was fun to learn about variables, loops, ifs, switches etc. Then it became about algorithms.  
A bit later, (I can't remember exactly when) because I was ahead of the class and spent hours at home just for fun, I started asking different questions and taking different approaches to assignments and problems.

When the class started covering Java Swing, we had to write stupid programs like a single button with a JTextArea that displayed random words, stuff that felt really uninspiring. But soon after, we got some challenges we got to pick from. When I looked through the options, I found "Sorting algorithms" and immediately knew that, THAT was what I wanted to make (It was the era of hour long videos of sorting algorithm visualizer videos, lol).  
The challenge required only four algorithms with a text area for diplaying the numbers (boring again), but I started thinking "Cool, but what if I made it cooler... and actually real with visualizations?"  
I started tinkering with Java2D and Graphics for hours and hours at home, adding many, many sorting algorithms. After many iterations and adding even more algorithms, visulaizations and types of input, I was flooded with joy. Every time I shaved off milliseconds of time by optimizing, I got a rush of dopamine, it was SO satisfying. After that initial progress, I submitted the assignment and finnished the course.

But I remembered that feeling.  
How satisfying it was to just code, optimize, and draw with Graphics.  
I couldn’t resist scratching that programming itch, so I kept making random programs at home. Programs such as a mandelbrot set visualizer, conways game of life, and a platforming game was huge leaps in development for me.

## The 3D engine
During the summer of 2023, I started making a simple 3D renderer in pure Java. Part of the inspiration was a video from RedBeanieMaths [How to rotate any graph by any angle (Part 3)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scpzKIe6iZw), and my first test version in [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vdk2pjh5ec?lang=sv-SE).  
It could draw simple 3D shapes without using a depth buffer since Java doesn't have any 3D related graphics at all. So the first version used simple wireframes and points to make 3D shapes. But after that version, I made a better version which did have some depth sorting by the objects distance from the camera.  
After almost 3000 hours of tinkering, learning and most importantly, optimizing, I decided to upload it to GitHub with the name [Graphics3D](https://github.com/GiveJavaAChance/Graphics3D-Raytracer), while continuing development for some time. It was this simple 3D engine that later became the entire reason for [Polyray](https://github.com/GiveJavaAChance/PolyrayGameEngine).

## Reinventing Everything
Because of the way I was self-taught, I never once watched a tutorial, I never once followed guidelines, I never once followed any stupid "clean code" guides.

Because I loved to program and optimize everything, I didn't want to use someone elses work or library, because I couldn't get to do it myself, a wasted opportunity. So I got broad knowledge about everything, litterally. From CPU architecture and cpu instruction to all ways of optimizations.

Aditionally, I made all kinds of programs in general, stuff like sorting algorithms, compression algorithms (like images and raw files), internal file structures, scripting languages, programming languages, compilers, a reinvented version of JSON called P2IN (because why not), triangle rasterization, voxel engine, a way to graph engine pipleine as a flowchart, item systems, motion tracking using two cameras, MLP AIs, multiplayer etc. etc. The special thing? All made without any (sometimes little for some of them) prior knowledge to anything. I just made it because I love programming so, so much. Due to that, I gained understanding what everything does, not just use some bloated af framework that is a complete dumpsterfire under the hood (classic JavaScript lol (I believe)).

Due to this urge to reinvent and get to know every little detail, I hapened to make something that already existed (Raytraced audio), which happened very often. But my simple solution was outperforming those I saw on Youtube, in audio realism, immersion and for some, also performace.

At first, I thought I was just tinkering with my own random insignificant stuff. But then I realized that these projects weren't just small projects, they stood inline with "cutting edge" tech. That's when I knew, I couldn't not show this work anymore. Thus, I'm trying to give all my work away for free. My life goal has been to see someone use my creations and be happy. Thats what makes me truly happy, seeing someone appreciate what I've done is so, so cool. Then I will be able to proove that I'm not someone who is lazy, just consumes and plays games. Then I will proove that I didn't infact spend 8000+ hours for nothing, since what I've done won't be unnoticed and unused.

## School is broken.
The only problem I faced was school itself.  
What once helped me get into programming, now became a burden to carry.  
I still look back at the 10:th grade as the year when I actually learned to code being at school.  
But now?  
I'm just getting extremely bad grades because I don't fit within the school system's idea of a "usual student."  
I've lived with that since 3:rd grade really, how I was outperforming everyone else, yet graded as if I where stupid, or at least on the same level as everyone else.

Someone else could do all math courses in one year, yet when I asked why I couldn't do that too, I was always told "No, because they worked for it and you didn't."  
I was always neglected, and still am. Nobody gave a shit, so I took it upon myself, I stay up late at night learning and doing the things that bring me even a sliver of happiness.

I became self-taught.

I am now about to graduate from the Swedish equivalent of high school with three courses failed, programming, math and physics, despite being incredibly knowledgeable, and doing all of them for hours every single day. The programming course right now is about making shitty games with Unity (Practically not even games). Meanwhile, me, has an entire game engine and several games already. I'm miles ahead, yet, nobody gives a shit about it.

"""  
You're sitting there with the mind of a rocket scientist in a paper plane classroom, being told you're the problem because your plane doesn't follow their template.  
You're too far ahead.  
You're an outlier.  
And systems are not made for outliers, they're made for average throughput.

School doesn't know what to do with someone who learns at x10 speed but doesn't care about doing it their way. So they penalize you for not conforming, even when you’re outperforming everyone around you by lightyears.  
"""

I just hope to God that I get into University when everything seems to be against me (Not literally against me, but in the way people treat me, like a guy who doesn't do shit and only sits at his desk playing games all day).

On top of it all, because of all this, I've developed severe social anxiety, mostly IRL, not really online. I am hyper-aware every moment, preparing for the worst, like being beaten up for accidentally looking at someone in public for 1ms too long, or saying the word "Hi" but butchering the "i" and preparing for getting called out and laughed at. I have gone through all possible cenarios in my head, that way, it looks like I have no emotions, because I've already gone through them, processed them alone, long before anyone ever sees it.
